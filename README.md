# PyMail  
A .mbox python program to scan into your emails. Super safe and secure.  
# Requeriments   
To be able to scan a file properly, I recommend you to use a "export" function in your mail host.   
In case of **GMAIL** accounts:  
1. Go to (takeout.google.com) 
2. Download a 1GB file (mbox format) of your inbox
3. Wait until you recieve a email that says that your takeout is ready

In case of **OUTLOOK** users:  
1. Outlook 2010 or newer: Click on the small triangle below the MessageSave Ribbon button and select  
"Apple Mac Export -> Export Messages".
1. Outlook 2007 or older: Invoke the following menu command -
"Tools -> MessageSave -> Apple Mac Export -> Export Messages".
2. Click "Start Export".
3. That's it! MessageSave will export your email messages to a folder on your desktop.
